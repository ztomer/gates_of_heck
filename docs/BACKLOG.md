# BACKLOG — forward-looking work (rule #13)

One file; prune landed items to git history. Seeded from EVAL-2026-09-04.md
(delete that file once this list is accepted as the transfer).

## Open

- Secrets v2: entropy heuristics for unknown key shapes. Blocked on FP
  tuning first — v1 (prefixes + key headers) ships instead. Measure FP
  rate on all consumer trees before enforcing.
- shfmt enforcement: dropped from the shell-lint gate (tree uses aligned
  continuations shfmt won't reproduce). Revisit only as reformat-everything
  (noisy) or an explicit shfmt flag set proven clean on this tree.
- Swift coverage: parity-pinned, not merged. A merge needs a real-swift
  oracle proving identical verdicts across Xcode versions; without that
  toolchain, merging violates prove-before-claim. Revisit when it exists.
- Periodic disk watch: `scripts/bin/disk_hygiene.sh --warn-only` wants a
  launchd schedule (the prune-logs plist is the pattern). Manual runs only
  until then.
- `secret-ok` scope: line + line-above only. If fixture pressure appears,
  consider (not promise) path-scoped allow rules — never bare markers.
- Cross-run verdict cache (`GOH_CACHE`): designed, NOT built (Rust-port
  Phase 3d, 2026-09-23). After staged blobs were shared the native scanners
  cost tens of ms; what remains of a staged run is spawns inside delegated
  steps, which a verdict cache does not touch. If it is ever built, every way
  a hit can lie needs a test first: a config key the checker reads but the
  key omits; a blob hashed at another scope than policed (index truth is
  non-negotiable); a cached "clean" over ZERO files (the empty-scope refusal
  must survive a hit); a checker whose version changed. Re-open when a
  measured staged run is dominated by native scan time, not spawns.
- `lcov_merge` native port: killed by its entry gate (Phase 4b). The largest
  consumer (monitor, 6 parts) merges in 76 ms; the bar was a measured >1 s.
  Re-open when a consumer measures a merge over 1 s.
- `check_tests_registered.py` / `check_generated_fresh.py` stay Python: no
  shared gate runs them (Phase 3c scoped to what the gates actually invoke).

## Done (prune to history)

- Rust-port arc (2026-09-23, `docs/rust-port-plan.md` retired into git
  history): one shared tree walk and a single shellcheck call (staged shell
  lint ~640 ms faster); native home-paths, ceiling + ratchet, no-allow,
  screen presentation, lints opt-in and skills corpus, each parity-pinned and
  red-proven both ways; `goh-golden` bit-identical to the numpy tier
  (numpy's pairwise summation reproduced); staged blobs read once per run
  (197 git spawns → 15 on a 50-file commit).

- v0.8.0 arc: disk watch out of CI, pooled du, parallel suite, shell lint,
  rust coverage floor, secrets v1, swift parity, doctor, timeouts, timing,
  mcp split, xdist grouping, stub dedup, doc refresh.
